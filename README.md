**📌 Overview**

This project explores the factors contributing to student depression by combining data analysis in SQL with interactive visualizations in Tableau.
The goal was to uncover patterns and relationships between various stress factors — such as academic pressure, financial stress, study satisfaction, sleep duration, and study hours — to gain actionable insights into mental health challenges among students.
